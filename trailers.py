Steam QTPD — store trailer index
===========================================================================
One SEPARATE, independent job that owns the TRAILER layer: for each appid, the
CDN filename(s) of its store trailer, so the frontend can play a video preview
when you hover a game's thumbnail.

WHY THIS NEEDS A SCRAPE AT ALL
------------------------------
Thumbnails are free: every capsule/header image URL is derivable from the appid
alone (`.../steam/apps/<appid>/header.jpg`), which is why the hover-enlarge has
never needed a data layer. Trailers are NOT. A trailer is addressed by a hashed CDN
path that nothing about the appid predicts — Dota 2 (570) serves its microtrailer from
`570/116737/313addee2092d0bd6f538d164610061ea8bbe79c/1749859757/microtrailer.webm`,
where only the leading `570` is derivable. It has to be looked up and stored. Hence:
one more file, one more job (ARCHITECTURE §1, one writer per file).

THE ENDPOINT
------------
IStoreBrowseService/GetItems/v1 with `data_request.include_trailers`. Same batched
endpoint price_and_sale.py already uses for sale end-dates, on api.steampowered.com
(the big budget, not the 200-per-5-min storefront one), 50 appids per call. A full
sweep of the ~127k catalog is ~2.5k calls = ~50 minutes.

WHAT VALVE ACTUALLY RETURNS (verified 2026-08-19 via QTPD_DUMP_TRAILERS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The first dump run corrected two assumptions that would have shipped broken:

  1. THERE IS NO PROGRESSIVE FULL TRAILER ANY MORE. The old movie480/movie_max
     .webm/.mp4 files are gone. A highlight now carries exactly two things:
       * `microtrailer`: [{filename, type}] -- Valve's own ~6s silent loop, in
         webm AND mp4. This is the ONLY natively playable asset.
       * `adaptive_trailers`: [{cdn_path, encoding}] -- dash_av1.mpd,
         dash_h264.mpd, hls_264_master.m3u8. These are DASH/HLS MANIFESTS: a
         plain <video src> cannot play them without dash.js/hls.js, which a
         static site should not be shipping. We record only that they exist
         (`adaptive` in the output header) so the option stays visible.
     So the hover preview is the microtrailer -- which is exactly what Steam
     itself plays when you hover a capsule in the store.

  2. `trailer_url_format` IS RELATIVE, and its placeholder is `${FILENAME}`,
     not `{FILENAME}`:
         "steam/apps/${FILENAME}?t=1762820639"
     The prefix before the placeholder is a CDN-relative PATH, so it has to be
     joined onto a CDN host (CDN_HOST). The `?t=` suffix is a cache-buster and
     is dropped. Filenames themselves are now long hashed paths that begin with
     the appid, e.g.
         570/116737/313addee.../1749859757/microtrailer.webm

Set QTPD_DUMP_TRAILERS=1 to re-dump the raw blob AND probe the candidate CDN
hosts (probe_hosts) from a runner that can actually reach Steam -- a sandbox
with Steam blocked cannot, which is why this file guesses nothing about hosts
that the dump has not confirmed.

Output trailers.json (served to the browser), format trailers_v2:
  { "base": "<absolute CDN prefix>",
    "trailers": { "<appid>": ["<file>.webm", "<file>.mp4"] } }
One flat list per game, best-codec-first, from the FIRST highlight only (a game
like TF2 exposes 17 trailers; the frontend plays one). The frontend emits one
<source> per entry and lets the browser choose. Games with no playable trailer
are absent -- the hover panel falls back to the enlarged still.

Output trailers_state.json (NOT served; the queue's memory, like catalog.json):
  { "misses": { "<appid>": <ts> }, "swept_at": <ts> }
A miss is re-checked after MISS_TTL_DAYS, because an unreleased game gains a
trailer later.

Ownership (one writer per file):
  scraper.py      -> games.json    (catalog, rating, tags, last_update, release)
  price_and_sale  -> prices.json   (price, discount %, sale end)
  THIS            -> trailers.json + trailers_state.json
Reads games.json (read-only) for the appid list and review counts.
