Steam QTPD — store screenshot index
===========================================================================
One SEPARATE, independent job that owns the SCREENSHOT layer: for each appid, the
CDN filenames of its store screenshots, so the hover panel can rotate real gameplay
stills instead of showing one piece of key art.

WHY THIS NEEDS A SCRAPE AT ALL
------------------------------
Same reason trailers.py exists, and it is worth restating because the thumbnail path
has trained everyone to expect the opposite. Capsule/header art is FREE — every URL is
derivable from the appid alone (`.../steam/apps/<appid>/header.jpg`), which is why the
hover-enlarge never needed a data layer. Screenshots are NOT: they are addressed by a
content hash (`ss_<sha1>.jpg`) that nothing about the appid predicts. index.html's T6
fallback chain says so in as many words — "no screenshot step — screenshot URLs aren't
derivable from appid". So they have to be looked up and stored.

WHY NOT THE PICS FIELD WE ALREADY HAVE
--------------------------------------
PICS carries a `store_screenshot` field and pics_refresh.py already fetches it, so it
looks free. It is not usable (measured over all 64 pics_raw shards, 2026-08-19):

  * present for 14,975 of 126,742 apps = 11.8%, and it is ONE image, not a set
  * Valve stopped populating it: 61-63% of 2016-2018 releases carry it, 29% of 2019,
    0.8% of 2020, and ~0.0% of everything 2023 and later
  * it is INVERSELY correlated with popularity — only 3 of the top 500 most-reviewed
    games have it (0.6%) — because the maintained, migrated store pages are exactly
    the ones that dropped it

It is a legacy field from before `store_item_assets`, and it is dead for anything
current. Hence this job.

THE ENDPOINT
------------
IStoreBrowseService/GetItems/v1 with `data_request.include_screenshots`. The same
batched endpoint trailers.py and price_and_sale.py already use, on api.steampowered.com
(the big budget, not the 200-per-5-min storefront one), 50 appids per call. A full sweep
of the ~127k catalog is ~2.5k calls = ~50 minutes, so the first run drains the whole
backlog and every run after it is near-instant.

EXPECTED COVERAGE
-----------------
Unlike a trailer, screenshots are effectively MANDATORY: Valve requires a minimum of 5
to publish a store page. Trailers are optional and trailers.json still resolved 96.4% of
the catalog, so this layer should land at or above that. That is an inference from
Valve's submission rules, not a measurement — QTPD_DUMP_SHOTS=1 turns it into a number.

WHAT WE HAVE NOT VERIFIED (run the dump before trusting the parser)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Steam is unreachable from the dev sandbox, so unlike trailers.py — whose surprises were
caught by a dump run — the exact response shape here is INFERRED. Two specific unknowns:

  1. THE KEY PATH. Expected `screenshots.all_ages_screenshots[] = {filename, ordinal}`,
     with `mature_content_screenshots` alongside. extract_shots() therefore refuses to
     hardcode one path: it tries the named keys, then any list-of-dicts under
     `screenshots`, and pulls `filename`/`path`-shaped values out of whatever it finds.
  2. THE SERVING HOST. `ss_<sha1>.jpg` is expected under the same `store_item_assets/`
     root the frontend already uses for modern header art (index.html ASSET_CDN), with
     an `<appid>/` segment in the path. probe_shot_hosts() HEADs a real filename across
     the host x root matrix under the dump flag and prints whatever actually returns an
     image, exactly as trailers.py settled its own base.

Set QTPD_DUMP_SHOTS=1 (workflow input `dump`) to dump the raw blob, report per-batch
coverage, probe the CDN hosts, and exit without writing anything.

ADULT CONTENT
-------------
Only `all_ages_screenshots` is stored. Valve splits mature stills into
`mature_content_screenshots`, and a game can carry those WITHOUT tripping the frontend's
PICS-based 18+ gate (pics_summarize `adult` = content_desc 3/4) — in which case the
rotation would show unblurred mature images on a thumbnail that was never gated. Storing
only the all-ages set makes that impossible. A game with nothing but mature stills is
recorded as a miss. The mature set stays available for a later change that reads the
adult flag, but that is a deliberate decision, not this job's default.

Output shots/shard_NN.json (served, sharded by `appid % 64`), format shots_v1:
  { "_format": "shots_v1", "_shard": NN, "base": "<absolute CDN prefix>",
    "count": N, "shots": { "<appid>": ["<file>.jpg", ...] } }

SHARDED, not one flat file, and this is the one place this layer departs from
trailers.json. A trailer is one short filename list per game and the frontend needs the
whole map at load; screenshots are ~4 hashes per game (~25MB across the catalog) and
ONLY the row you actually hover ever needs them. So the frontend fetches `appid % 64`
on first hover and caches it — ~400KB once, instead of 25MB on every page load, on a
page that already pulls ~240MB of JSON. Same idiom as pics_raw/ and updates_raw/.

Output shots_state.json (NOT served; the queue's memory, like catalog.json):
  { "misses": { "<appid>": <ts> }, "swept_at": <ts> }
A miss is re-checked after MISS_TTL_DAYS, because an unreleased or freshly-listed game
gains screenshots later.

Ownership (one writer per file):
  scraper.py      -> games.json    (catalog, rating, tags, last_update, release)
  price_and_sale  -> prices.json   (price, discount %, sale end)
  trailers.py     -> trailers.json + trailers_state.json
  THIS            -> shots/shard_NN.json + shots_state.json
Reads games.json (read-only) for the appid list and review counts.

#   .../store_item_assets/steam/apps/578080/<sha1>/ss_<sha1>.jpg       (hash-dir)
# shared.cloudflare, shared.akamai and shared.fastly all serve both. Note that
# cdn.cloudflare/cdn.akamai + `steam/apps/` serve the FLAT shape and 404 the hash-dir one:
# a probe of a single sample would have blessed a base that is right for only part of the
# catalog, which is why the dump probes one sample per distinct rooting.
#
# CORRECTED 2026-08-19 after the first real sweep. Valve returns these filenames already
# rooted at `steam/apps/<appid>/<file>`, so the original base (which ended in
# `steam/apps/`) produced `.../store_item_assets/steam/apps/steam/apps/<appid>/...` —
# every URL doubled and 404'd. This is the exact mirror of the trap trailers.py fell into
# from the other direction, where the learned prefix was NOT the whole path: the lesson is
# that the split between "base" and "filename" is Valve's to decide, not ours to assume.
# The resulting URL now matches the shape the site already serves header art from
# (index.html ASSET_CDN + `<appid>/<hash>/header.jpg`), which is the one piece of evidence
# available without a runner: `store_item_assets/steam/apps/<appid>/<file>`.
# cloudflare over akamai to match the host the capsule art already comes from.
# akamai rather than cloudflare, though the probe showed both serving every rooting: this
# is the host ASSET_CDN already pulls every modern header image from, so it is the one edge
# the page continuously demonstrates works for whoever is looking at it. A host the app has
# never used is an unproven dependency, and when it fails for a viewer the rotation just
# silently never starts. The frontend falls back across all three regardless (SHOT_HOSTS in
# index.html); this only decides which one is tried first.
